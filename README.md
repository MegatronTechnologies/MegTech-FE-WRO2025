## üß† Code Logic

### Task 1 ‚Äî Autonomous Laps with Turning
The first task focuses on driving forward, detecting obstacles, and completing a set number of laps.  
The program is triggered by pressing a button, ensuring the race only starts when intended.  

**Main logic flow:**
1. **System Initialization**  
   - Raspberry Pi 5 starts RealSense depth camera pipeline.  
   - Motors, servo, and button are initialized.  
   - Safety reset ensures motors are stopped and servo is centered.  

2. **Start Condition**  
   - Robot waits for the physical button press.  
   - Button press sets a global flag and starts the race sequence.  

3. **Forward Movement**  
   - Robot drives forward at a set speed.  
   - Constantly checks distance from the RealSense depth camera.  
   - If an obstacle is detected closer than **90 cm**, the robot stops.  

4. **Turning**  
   - After stopping, the robot performs a turn in a predefined direction (left or right, configurable by variable).  
   - Servo adjusts steering angle.  
   - Motor powers the rear wheels for a short time to complete the turn.  
   - After turning, the servo is reset to center.  

5. **Lap Counter**  
   - This process repeats for the configured number of laps (4 laps).  
   - After finishing, all systems reset and the robot stops safely.  

This approach ensures **repeatable and safe behavior** while respecting the competition‚Äôs rule of using only **one motor for the driving axle**.
